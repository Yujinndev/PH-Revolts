        The Filipino struggle against Spanish colonization demonstrated their
        strong desire for independence, but their attempts faced challenges. Due
        to its archipelagic topography, the Philippines presented difficulties
        with communication that impeded coordinated rebellion. Uprisings
        frequently lacked unity and national leadership, with local leaders
        spearheading isolated, irregular revolts. Due to their dispersed
        strategy, the rebels were ignorant of concurrent movements occurring in
        other areas like as Bohol and Leyte. Spain took advantage of regional
        differences by hiring residents from other areas to put down uprisings
        and used methods such as assassination to crush opposition. Spanish
        military might and technological superiority also made it possible for
        them to put down uprisings successfully. One major hindrance to the
        cohesive struggle against Spanish rule was the lack of a collective
        national sense among the Filipino people. Because of their limited
        exposure to and education on wider national issues, many Filipinos were
        ignorant about them. But by the early 19th century, attempts were being
        made to solve these issues, which marked a turning point in the fight
        for independence.
